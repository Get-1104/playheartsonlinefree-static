      <h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play Hearts</h2>
      <p>Hearts is a trick-taking card game where you want to avoid penalty cards. Each round begins with a card pass, then players follow suit and win tricks based on the highest card in the lead suit. Hearts are worth 1 point each, and the Queen of Spades is worth 13 points. The player with the lowest total score wins.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow suit if possible; otherwise, play any card.</li>
        <li>Hearts cannot be led until they are broken.</li>
        <li>Shooting the moon gives all points to your opponents.</li>
      </ul>
